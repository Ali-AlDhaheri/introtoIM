Generations through generations
Kings and Queens of the past
Kingdoms of reincarnations
Little do they know it won't last

As time eats away the wealth
We seek to find a better living
With each step filled with stealth
Time will always find an aging

A crown of richness and purity
Passes down on each heir
Signs of abstruse ambiguity
Who would be next to bare?
